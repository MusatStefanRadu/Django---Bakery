    I developed a bakery management web application using Django, designed to streamline order processing, inventory management, and customer interactions. The system enables efficient tracking of products, order status updates, and user authentication for both customers and administrators. It includes features such as product categorization, promotions, and delivery options to enhance the bakery's operational efficiency. The application ensures a smooth workflow by integrating a structured database and a user-friendly interface, making daily management tasks easier and more efficient.
